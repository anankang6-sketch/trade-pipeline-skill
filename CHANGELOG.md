## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-09

Adversarial-review remediation. Two independent AI reviews (Claude Sonnet 5 self-review + Claude Fable 5 cross-check, both recorded under `docs/adversarial-review-2607*.md`) found buyer-matching false positives, a silent LLM-degradation path, and a silent price-column fallback — all capable of producing a structurally valid but factually wrong PI/CI without any error surfacing. This release closes those gaps.

### Fixed
- **Buyer fuzzy matching redesigned** (`buyer_matcher.py`): replaced unbounded bidirectional substring matching with "strip legal-form suffix, compare core names." Previously, short aliases (`"GF"`, `"Apex"`) participated in substring matching and could silently match unrelated companies (`"GF Industrial Supply"`, `"Apexon Software Ltd"`); a long legal name could also substring-match a completely different company sharing a prefix (`"Global Fasteners LLC"` vs `"Global Fasteners Trading LLC"`). Now: aliases are exact-match only; fuzzy matching strips legal suffixes (LLC/Ltd/GmbH/ООО/etc.) and requires the remaining "core name" to match exactly — extra real words (Trading, International) are rejected, suffix-only differences (Co vs Corp) are accepted; ambiguous matches across multiple buyers hard-block to `review.json` instead of picking one.
- **LLM parse fallback no longer silently swallows data errors** (`llm_parser.py`): `except Exception` was catching network errors, auth failures, and malformed-JSON responses identically and falling back to rules mode without any signal — a user who explicitly requested `--use-llm` for a complex inquiry could silently get lower-accuracy rules-mode output with no indication anything degraded. Now split into two paths: `anthropic.APIError` (network/timeout/auth) falls back silently as before (genuine infra fault), while response-parsing failures (`json.JSONDecodeError`, malformed schema) fall back **and** tag the result with `_llm_degraded` + a reason string.
- **Price write-back no longer silently misreads the wrong column** (`price_updater.py`): `_find_price_column` used to fall back to a hardcoded column F when the "Price" header couldn't be found — if a user reordered quotation columns, prices would silently be read from the wrong cell and written back incorrectly. Now raises `PriceUpdateError` instead of guessing.
- **Product-name translation no longer stops after the first match** (`canonicalizer.py`): a description containing multiple Chinese product names (e.g. "六角螺栓配平垫圈") only had the first one translated before the loop broke, leaving the rest in Chinese on customer-facing documents. Now replaces all matches; translation table iterates longest-term-first so short terms can no longer clip a longer term mid-match.
- **First-run demo experience**: `config.yaml`'s template ships with empty `sellers`/`buyers`, but no code path actually loaded `examples/demo_config.yaml` for the README/SKILL.md-advertised demo walkthrough — `python -m trade_pipeline --buyer global_fasteners` on a fresh checkout hard-blocked with an entity-resolution error. `load_config()` now merges the demo config into memory when `sellers` is empty (never writes to disk, never touches a real config).

### Added
- `_llm_degraded` flag is now consumed: `main.py` prints a visible warning (`⚠ 本次为降级结果`) with the failure reason whenever the LLM parse fell back due to a data/parsing error, instead of the degradation being invisible to the user.
- `trade-pipeline-run` SKILL.md: buyer-match-failure review flow must now resolve each candidate's `name_en` from `config.yaml` and show real company names via `AskUserQuestion` — `review.json`'s `candidate_values` only stores raw buyer_id strings, so showing the bare ids was not actionable for a user. The Skill may no longer infer/guess a buyer from context and write `resolved_value` without the user explicitly naming it.
- `trade-pipeline-run` SKILL.md: mandatory reminder after any PI/CI generation or price write-back — "PI/CI 是正式对外单证，发送给客户前请人工核对买家抬头、金额、税号是否正确." Automated precheck validates structure (missing fields, bad formats), not business correctness — it cannot catch a correctly-formatted document sent to the wrong buyer.
- 9 new tests: LLM-degradation three-path contract (`test_llm_parser_fallback.py`), missing-price-column hard block, buyer negative-match / suffix-variant cases (218 → 227 total).

[1.3.0]: https://github.com/Dangooy/trade-pipeline-skill/releases/tag/v1.3.0

## [1.2.2] - 2026-06-13

Pre-internal-test patch. Fixes v1.2.1 regressions + adds error-log infrastructure. GUI/CI/docs only, no business logic changes.

### Added
- Error log infrastructure: `setup_logging()` writes rotating `app.log` (2MB×3) under `user_data_root()/logs`; uncaught exceptions and Qt warnings captured via `sys.excepthook` + `qInstallMessageHandler`; worker failures logged with traceback; "export logs" button on Generate/Price-Update tabs zips logs for support
- GUI offscreen smoke now runs in CI (was never gated — the cause of v1.2.0/1.2.1 stale title/Tab assertions slipping through)

### Fixed
- `verify_gui_smoke.py` stale assertions (v1.2.0 title / 2-tab) updated to v1.2.1 three-tab + tab-text check
- `PLOnlyWorker` now forwards `output_dir` to the pipeline (defensive: packing-gateway re-run would otherwise drop PL into the default folder). Note: this GenerateTab gateway path is currently unreachable (inquiry sheets have no price column → always partial_ok), so verification is a wiring unit test; PriceUpdateTab is the reachable re-run path

### Changed
- Status bar label "输出目录" → "默认输出目录"; Generate tab output field relabeled "输出根目录" with "auto-creates an order-number subfolder" hint
- Version bumped to 1.2.2

[1.2.2]: https://github.com/Dangooy/trade-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.2.2

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-12

First-feedback patch after the v1.2.0 release. GUI-only, no business logic changes.

### Added
- Runtime window/taskbar icon: `app.setWindowIcon` now loads `app.ico` (bundled into the runtime package); Windows AppUserModelID set so the taskbar groups under its own app instead of `python.exe`
- Generate tab: custom output directory field — leave blank for the default (`output_root()/<order>`), or pick a folder; "open output folder" follows the actual directory used

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.2.1 (metadata three places + window title + version_info)

[1.2.1]: https://github.com/Dangooy/trade-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.2.1

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-12

Desktop GUI productization. Consolidates pre-releases v1.2.0-alpha.1 through alpha.5.

### Added
- Three-tab desktop GUI (PySide6): 生成单据 (Generate) / 价格回写 (Price Update) / 配置中心 (Config)
- ConfigTab: visual CRUD for sellers/buyers with atomic YAML write + automatic `.bak` backup
- First-run experience: blank template (`sellers`/`buyers` cleared) + "load sample data" button; demo entities moved to `examples/demo_config.yaml`, merged incrementally without overwriting existing entries
- Pre-generation check engine: 10 rules producing a Chinese report, with blocking semantics (error blocks, warning confirmable, info advisory)
- Price write-back tab: pick filled quotation → auto-pair `model.json` → run write-back → structured precheck handling → packing gateway closed loop for missing weights
- `run_price_update` structured return: `precheck_report` (`has_errors`/`has_warnings`/`errors`/`warnings`) and `packing_review_json` output for GUI gateway integration
- Offscreen GUI smoke scripts (`verify_first_run`, `verify_gui_partial_success`, `verify_price_update`, `verify_gui_smoke`)

### Changed
- `app.py` slimmed to a `QTabWidget` shell; window title bumped to v1.2.0
- GenerateTab `partial_ok` signal distinguishes "quotation generated, formal docs pending price" from real failures
- Version metadata bumped to 1.2.0 (pyproject / plugin.json / `trade_pipeline_gui.__version__`)

### Fixed
- `assembler.py` hardcoded seller fallback removed; `_assemble_model` now catches early `EntityResolutionError` instead of leaking a traceback
- Price-update error/warning distinction now driven by structured `precheck_report` (no fragile message-string matching); warning-confirm loop no longer re-runs infinitely
