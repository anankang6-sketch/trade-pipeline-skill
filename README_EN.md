## How to use it: an AI Skill

This is an **AI Agent Skill** (in SKILL.md format). Once installed, you just talk to it in plain language —
"Turn this inquiry into a Quotation," "The customer confirmed, generate the PI/CI/PL" — and the AI handles the whole process. No commands to memorize.

👉 Install and use it: [with Claude Code](#use-skill) · [with Tencent WorkBuddy](#use-workbuddy)

## Does this sound like your week?

- Customer sends an inquiry Excel → you manually **copy** product names, specs, and quantities into a Quotation
- Customer confirms → you manually **copy the same data again** to make a PI
- Goods are ready → you **copy it all again** to make the CI and Packing List
- A quantity typo in the PI → the CI, PL, and customs paperwork **all inherit the error**, and you have to hunt them down one by one
- Different customers need different PI formats (Russian customers want Russian, European customers want English) → you end up maintaining **several template sets**

**Every document is essentially the same data in a different layout**, but you rebuild it from scratch every single time.

Trade Pipeline's solution is simple: **maintain a single order record, and generate every document from it automatically. Change one thing, and all four documents update together.**

---

## What it does for you

**Automatically turns** a customer's inquiry Excel into the full set of documents:

| Document | Description |
|------|------|
| 📋 **Quotation** | Company letterhead, product line items, unit price column left blank for you to fill in |
| 📄 **Proforma Invoice (PI)** | Seller/buyer information, payment terms, trade terms |
| 📄 **Commercial Invoice (CI)** | Bilingual (Chinese/English) header, shipping marks, shipment info, SAY amount |
| 📦 **Packing List (PL)** | Per-carton breakdown, carton count/weight/quantity, pallet summary |

**Quotation** — fill in unit prices in the yellow-highlighted column, then write them back to the order record with one click:

![Quotation](docs/2601_quotation.png)

**Proforma Invoice (PI)** — seller/buyer header, grouped product rows, payment terms:

![PI](docs/2601_pi.png)

**Commercial Invoice (CI)** — bilingual Chinese/English, shipping marks, shipment info, SAY amount in words:

![CI](docs/2601_ci.png)

**Packing List (PL)** — grouped line items, carton count/weight/quantity, net/gross weight, pallet summary:

![PL](docs/2601_pl.png)

## Who this is for

| Your situation | Good fit? |
|---|---|
| No ERP, running on Excel + email + WeChat | ✅ **Core use case, use it directly** |
| Have Yonyou/Kingdee/Wangdiantong, but weak trade-document support | ✅ Good fit, fills the gap on document input/output |
| Using an open-source ERP like Odoo / ERPNext | ✅ Can be integrated as an inquiry-parsing module |
| Using SAP B1 / NetSuite / Dynamics 365 with a mature setup | ⚠️ Not much added value |
| Tens of thousands of orders a year, already on EDI/API integration | ❌ Use an enterprise-grade solution instead |

### Best-fit profile

- Annual order volume: **50–500 orders**
- Product SKUs: **< 5,000**
- Primary markets: **Russia / Eastern Europe / South America / Middle East**
- Team size: **1–3 trade sales staff**

> **No coding background at all?** That's fine. Once you've read the sections above, you'll know whether this is for you. The install and setup steps involve a bit of command-line work, but no programming knowledge is required — just copy and paste as you go.

## How it relates to your ERP

Trade Pipeline is **not a replacement for your ERP**. ERPs handle inventory, finance, receivables/payables, and tax — this tool doesn't do any of that, and isn't meant to.

What it fills in is the **front and back ends** that ERPs tend to handle poorly:

| Where ERPs fall short | How Trade Pipeline fills the gap |
|---|---|
| Customer inquiry Excels need to be **manually entered** | Automatically extracts product data |
| Inconsistent customer name spellings (especially common with Russian customers) that ERPs can't match | 4-layer fault-tolerant matching; if it can't match, it stops and lets you choose |
| Every customer wants a different PI/CI format, and changing ERP templates means calling a consultant | Just edit a config file — takes 5 minutes |
| Customer reorders rows after exporting the Quotation, and re-importing scrambles all the prices | Every row carries a hidden marker, so reordering rows never breaks anything |
| No dedicated field for DIN/ISO/GOST standard numbers | Automatically recognizes and normalizes standard numbers |

---

## What it is not

- ❌ **Not an ERP** — doesn't manage inventory, finance, or tax
- ❌ **Not an online system** — no accounts, no customer support portal; all data stays on your own computer
- ❌ **Not a multi-user collaboration platform** — best suited for teams of 1–3 people
- ❌ **Not "AI doing your trade business for you"** — the AI only helps parse messily formatted inquiries; everything else is deterministic, rule-based logic
- ❌ **Does not connect directly to customs** — it can prepare the data your customs broker needs, but it cannot submit directly to the Single Window system

---

## To be upfront: what industry this is built for

This tool was built **for my own company**, so it's shaped around the characteristics of the **hardware / fastener industry**:

- Pricing is **primarily weight-based** (KG / metric ton)
- Product specs are relatively fixed (the DIN / ISO / GOST standard-parts world)
- Packaging conventions are fairly standardized

**If you're also in hardware / fasteners** (bolts, nuts, washers, standard parts, wire products, pipe fittings, flanges, bearings, seals, etc.),
you can probably get it running just by updating your company info and the translation tables.

**If you're in a different industry**, your specs, pricing basis (per piece / per set / per meter), and weight/packaging logic will all differ,
so **this tool won't work out of the box** — you'd need to adapt it, mainly in these three places:

| What to change | Where |
|---|---|
| Product recognition / Chinese-English translation | `understanding/canonicalizer.py` + the translation tables |
| Pricing model (if not weight-based) | Pricing-detection logic in `understanding/` |
| Document templates (headers, fields, layout) | The individual Writers under `writers/` |

The framework itself is solid, but how much adaptation work you need depends on how complex your industry is.

> In short: **hardware / fasteners can use it as-is; other industries should treat it as an adaptable foundation.**

**Industries that would take more work**: apparel (complex size matrices), electronic components (nested BOMs), bulk commodities (futures-based pricing), cross-border e-commerce (tens of thousands of SKUs) — these require substantial rework, so go in with that expectation.

## Prerequisites

You'll need two things installed on your computer (skip anything you already have):

| Software | Purpose | Install guide |
|------|------|----------|
| **Python 3.12 or later** | Runs this tool | [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **Git** | Downloads the code | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) |

> Not sure if you have them? Open a command line (Windows: press Win+R and type `cmd`; Mac: open "Terminal"), then type `python --version` and `git --version`. If a version number shows up, you're good.

## Installation

<a id="use-skill"></a>
### Install and use it with Claude Code

If you haven't used [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) before: it's Anthropic's official AI coding / automation tool. Install it once, and you can use it for documents, drafting emails, and organizing data going forward. Once the plugin is installed, **just talk to it in plain language** — no commands to memorize.

**Step 1: Clone the repo and install the core engine**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dangooy/trade-pipeline-skill.git
cd trade-pipeline-skill
pip install -e .
```

**Step 2: Load the plugin in Claude Code**

This repo ships with a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) containing two Skills:

| Skill name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `trade-pipeline-init` | First-time setup wizard (company info, trade terms, first customer) |
| `trade-pipeline-run` | Runs the documentation pipeline / price write-back |

Launch Claude Code from within the repo directory, and use the `/plugin` command to load the local repo as a plugin (you'll need to trust this directory the first time). Once loaded, both Skills register automatically.

**Step 3: Just talk to it**

```text
Initialize configuration                             → triggers trade-pipeline-init, walks you through your company info step by step
Turn examples/sample_inquiry.xlsx into a Quotation    → triggers trade-pipeline-run, runs the full pipeline automatically
The customer confirmed, write back prices and generate the PI/CI/PL   → automatically writes back prices + generates the formal documents
```

> The Skill runs a deterministic engine behind the scenes to generate the documents — you never have to type parameters by hand. Just tell Claude what you need done, and it puts it together.

<a id="use-workbuddy"></a>
### Install and use it with Tencent WorkBuddy

If you're in China and using [WorkBuddy](https://codebuddy.cn/work) (Tencent's desktop AI agent), it works too — it's compatible with the SKILL.md skill format, so you just copy the skill directory over.

> **Prerequisite**: Python 3.11+ and Git must already be installed on your computer. This skill calls the Python engine underneath, so this step can't be skipped.

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
# 1. Download the project and install the engine
git clone https://github.com/Dangooy/trade-pipeline-skill.git
cd trade-pipeline-skill
pip install -e .

# 2. Copy both skills into the WorkBuddy skills directory
mkdir "$env:USERPROFILE\.workbuddy\skills" -Force
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force ".\.claude\skills\trade-pipeline-init" "$env:USERPROFILE\.workbuddy\skills\"
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force ".\.claude\skills\trade-pipeline-run"  "$env:USERPROFILE\.workbuddy\skills\"
```

**Mac / Linux (Terminal)**

```bash
# 1. Download the project and install the engine
git clone https://github.com/Dangooy/trade-pipeline-skill.git
cd trade-pipeline-skill
pip install -e .

# 2. Copy both skills into the WorkBuddy skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.workbuddy/skills
cp -r .claude/skills/trade-pipeline-init ~/.workbuddy/skills/
cp -r .claude/skills/trade-pipeline-run  ~/.workbuddy/skills/
```

Once installed, trigger it manually in a WorkBuddy conversation:

```text
@trade-pipeline-run Turn this inquiry into a Quotation
```

> Note: WorkBuddy runs on domestic models (Hunyuan / DeepSeek / GLM, etc.), not Claude. The skill's prompts are written for how Claude interprets instructions, so with a different model, triggering or step comprehension may occasionally be off — it's normal if it doesn't go smoothly the first time. Feel free to file an issue with feedback.

## First-time setup

Since your company information gets printed on the Quotation, PI, and CI, you'll need to fill in some basic details before first use.

Tell it **"Initialize configuration"** in Claude Code (this triggers `trade-pipeline-init`), and it will ask you for the following, one item at a time:

| Info | Used on | Required? |
|------|----------|--------|
| Company name (Chinese/English) | Header of every document | Yes |
| Address | PI/CI header | Yes |
| Contact person / email / phone | Quotation and PI | Yes |
| Bank details | PI payment info | No (can add later) |
| Trade terms | FOB / CIF / DDP / EXW / CFR | Yes |
| Currency | USD / CNY / EUR | Yes |
| Port of shipment | PI/CI footer | Yes |
| First customer | Buyer information | No (can start with a placeholder customer `_new`) |

> This information is stored in a file called `config/config.yaml`. YAML is a simple text format you can open and edit with any text editor — it reads like a shopping list, no programming knowledge required.

## Day-to-day use: just talk to Claude

Once the plugin is installed, you don't need to memorize any commands — just tell Claude what you need in plain language. Common phrasings:

| What you say to Claude | What it does |
|---|---|
| "Turn this inquiry into a Quotation" (with the Excel attached) | Parses the inquiry → generates a Quotation (for price negotiation with the customer) |
| "The customer confirmed, write back prices and generate the PI/CI/PL" | Writes the filled-in unit prices back to the order record → generates the Proforma Invoice / Commercial Invoice / Packing List |
| "This is a new customer, use a placeholder identity for the Quotation for now" | Generates the Quotation under a placeholder buyer identity; fill in customer details later |
| "The customer name didn't match, help me confirm it" | Lists candidate customers for you to choose from, then continues generating |

> **Recommended workflow**: generate the Quotation first to negotiate price, and only write back prices / generate the formal documents (PI/CI/PL) after the customer confirms.
> This way you don't have to redo the whole document set repeatedly during the quoting stage.

<details>
<summary>Developer reference: the underlying CLI commands (what the Skill calls behind the scenes)</summary>

```bash
# Phase 1: generate the Quotation only (for price negotiation with the customer)
python -m trade_pipeline --input inquiry.xlsx --order 2601 --buyer global_fasteners --quote-only

# Phase 2: after customer confirmation, write back prices + generate PI / CI / PL
python -m trade_pipeline --price-update output/2601/2601_quotation.xlsx --model output/2601/2601_model.json

# Generate everything in one go (for rush orders or demos):
python -m trade_pipeline --input inquiry.xlsx --order 2601 --buyer global_fasteners

# New customer (use a placeholder identity for now, fill in details later):
python -m trade_pipeline --input inquiry.xlsx --order 2601 --buyer _new --quote-only

# When the system can't match a customer name, it stops and generates review.json — confirm, then continue:
python -m trade_pipeline --input inquiry.xlsx --order 2601 --confirm output/2601/2601_review.json
```

## How this tool came to be

I'm not a professional programmer — I work in trade sales at a manufacturing factory, or more precisely, I'm what's called a "second-generation factory owner's kid." Given the limited resources available to me, I really needed a powerful assistant-type tool: an AGENT.

The reason this tool exists is simple: **I was spending several hours a week manually producing trade documents, and got sick of it.** Claude Code helped me turn years of accumulated business experience into a working automated system.

Here's an example: the first version of the price write-back feature worked by row number — the price on row 3 got written back to row 3. Technically correct. Until one day a customer inserted a few group-header rows into the Quotation, and when I ran the write-back — every price got shifted out of place, and the PI inherited the same errors.

I told Claude about the bug, and its first instinct was "exclude header rows during parsing." I said that wouldn't work — there's no predicting how a customer will edit an Excel file. We went back and forth for three rounds, and I finally suggested, "What if every row carried a hidden ID card?" Claude implemented the hidden UUID column approach.

**This kind of design doesn't show up in programming tutorials, because it came from a real production bug.**

> AI coding tools are at their most powerful when you bring deep domain knowledge — I know exactly what a PI should look like, because I've made hundreds of them by hand.

## Where your data lives

All customer information, order data, and generated documents **stay on your own computer** — nothing gets uploaded to any server.

| File | What it stores |
|------|--------|
| `config/config.yaml` | Your company info, customer info, trade terms (editable with any text editor) |
| `output/order-number/` | Each order's record and its full set of generated documents |

This means:
- ✅ You have complete control over your data
- ✅ You can track every change with Git
- ⚠️ You're responsible for your own backups (recommend periodically copying to an external drive or encrypted cloud storage)
